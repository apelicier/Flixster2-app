### Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I spent almost 6 hours of time to correct an error after adding the .jar file, after all this time of working and executing my project, I decided to check all my files line by line and finally find  the error I was looking for for 3 days (synchronization not done to the graddle file) 
the other one was the electricity problem in my country which makes this project extremely difficult to achieve. Finally I do it. It's very very challenging.
